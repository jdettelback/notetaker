## Installation
Open this application using the website linked below.


## Usage
This application uses an Express.js back end to write and save notes. It is deployed using Heroku. Notes can be written directly into the app.  Once a title is inputted and an item is inputted into the body of the note, a save button appears in the upper right corner. Individual notes appear on the left side of the screen and can be reopened once saved. Notes can also be deleted by clicking on the trash can next to the note title.
